    <h1>🌊 Engineering Immunity: How Technology Neutralizes 48% Dynamic Risk in Hydropower</h1>
    
    <p class="article-intro">This analysis demonstrates that the most significant threat to hydropower asset integrity is not component failure, but **Organizational Execution Gap**. Studies confirm that installation imperfections introduce a measurable <span class="font-bold text-red-600">48% dynamic instability risk</span> that accelerates asset degradation.</p>
    
    <h2>🚨 1. Organizational Compromise: The Ticking Bomb Thesis</h2>
    <p>The crisis is defined by the critical disconnect between perfect design and flawed field implementation (Execution Gap). Even the most precisely designed turbine is vulnerable to failure caused by simple **Installation Errors**—misalignments often invisible during standard commissioning.</p>
    
    <h2>🐳 2. The Solution: Hydrodynamic Harmony™ — Dual Application Strategy</h2>
    <p>Our innovative hypothesis finds its solution in nature's most efficient fluid dynamicist: the **Humpback Whale**. The **"Whale Fin" Rotor (Tubercle Concept)** integrates carefully shaped ridges to create **Hydrodynamic Immunity** – a design that tolerates human imperfection.</p>
