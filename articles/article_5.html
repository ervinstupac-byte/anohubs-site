    <h1>🤝 The Human Sensor: Why Ethics and Experience Guarantee Precision</h1>
    
    <p class="article-intro">
        My experience proves that a culture that tolerates injustice (ethical compromise) is the same culture that tolerates technical compromise (Execution Gap). You cannot have one without the other. **Intellectual and ethical discipline are the foundation of technical precision.**
    </p>

    <h2>1. The Human Sensor Advantage</h2>
    <p>AI is a powerful tool, but it does not replace the engineer in the field. Technical experts possess sensory knowledge that no current algorithm can replicate. Field experts know:</p>
    
    <ul class="list-disc ml-6 mb-6">
        <li>**The Sound of Cavitation:** The subtle frequency changes indicating erosion.</li>
        <li>**The Smell of Stress:** How metal smells when it is under excessive fatigue or overheating.</li>
        <li>**The Sight of Contamination:** How contaminated oil looks before a sensor alerts the system.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>This is the **Human Sensor**—the first and most vital layer of diagnostics that complements every digital sensor. Their intuitive assessment can prevent thousands of hours of downtime and save millions in repairs.</p>
    
    <blockquote>
        **Key Insight:** Relying solely on sensor data ignores the crucial knowledge gathered over decades of working directly with the machine. The human ability to synthesize sensory input provides superior early warning.
    </blockquote>

    <h2>2. The Ethical Imperative: Eliminating the 48% Risk</h2>
    <p>To successfully eliminate the **48% dynamic risk** (caused by human error during installation), engineers must be **empowered** to report faults immediately and without fear of consequence. Technical excellence cannot exist in a vacuum.</p>
    
    <ul class="list-disc ml-6 mb-6">
        <li>A culture that prioritizes safety, ethics, and worker rights is the only foundation for demanding **100% precision** in assembly and operation.</li>
        <li>When personnel are respected, they uphold high standards. When compromises are tolerated, technical failure follows.</li>
    </ul>
