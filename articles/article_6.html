    <h1>💣 Hidden Costs & Ticking Bombs: Systematic Review of Hydropower Mechanical Maintenance</h1>
    
    <p class="article-intro">
        The global problem in mechanical maintenance is not a matter of isolated failures, but a **systemic lack of a proactive maintenance culture**. The traditional reliance on reactive maintenance—repairs made only when a failure occurs—is the direct cause of most critical long-term costs. This approach guarantees that a minor oversight becomes a **Ticking Time Bomb**.
    </p>

    <h2>1. Relevant Statistics and General Data</h2>
    <p>Understanding these statistics is the first step toward risk mitigation:</p>
    <ul class="list-disc ml-6 mb-6">
        <li><strong>70–80%</strong> of mechanical equipment failures can be attributed to **inadequate maintenance or errors during assembly and installation**.</li>
        <li><strong>10–20%</strong> of a hydropower plant's total operating costs are related to maintenance, but these costs can **double or triple** in the event of a catastrophic failure.</li>
        <li>The service life of critical components can be shortened by <strong>50–70%</strong> if adequate lubrication, alignment, and regular inspections are not performed.</li>
        <li><strong>Load Margin:</strong> Sustained operation under temporary overload conditions (10–20% above nominal capacity) without adequate supervision drastically shortens the equipment's lifespan.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>2. Holistic Problem Breakdown: From Root Cause to Consequence</h2>
    <p>The biggest problem is not that parts wear out, but that the **root causes** of that wear are often ignored. These issues manifest in a critical chain of cause and effect:</p>

    <h3>A. Initial Problems (Root Causes)</h3>
    <ol class="list-decimal ml-6">
        <li><strong>Assembly and Installation Errors:</strong> Errors such as poor shaft alignment (the source of the 48% dynamic risk) or improper bolt tightening become a "ticking time bomb."</li>
        <li><strong>Electrical Factors:</strong> Problems with grounding, faulty protection, or inadequate automation lead to excessive mechanical stress, vibrations, and **electro-erosion on bearings**.</li>
        <li><strong>Inadequate Materials:</strong> The use of cheaper, low-quality materials and parts that do not meet specifications due to cost reduction pressure.</li>
        <li><strong>Lack of Training:</strong> Inexperienced personnel are the direct cause of assembly errors and maintenance oversights.</li>
    </ol>

    <h3>B. Consequences of Initial Problems (The Silent Killers)</h3>
    <ul class="list-disc ml-6 mb-6">
        <li><strong>Misalignment:</strong> Causes uneven load distribution and excessive vibrations, drastically reducing the lifespan of bearings and seals.</li>
        <li><strong>Vibrations:</strong> The "silent killer." They cause material fatigue and destroy critical components.</li>
        <li><strong>Contamination:</strong> Water, dirt, or foreign particles entering lubrication systems destroy oil properties, leading to rapid wear of critical components.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h3>C. Phase of Critical Failure (Terminal Phase)</h3>
    <p>Problems escalate, leading to catastrophic results:</p>
    <ul class="list-disc ml-6 mb-6">
        <li><strong>Cavitation and Erosion:</strong> Poor alignment of turbine blades leads to the formation of vapor bubbles (cavitation), destroying the rotor and reducing efficiency.</li>
        <li><strong>Bearing Failure:</strong> Bearings, stressed by vibrations and contaminated oil, fail, leading to overheating and the complete destruction of the shaft or generator.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>3. The Human and Strategic Factor: The True Root Cause</h2>
    <p>Technical failures are often a symptom of deeper organizational and human issues. This is where the true cost of compromise is found:</p>

        <h4 class="text-lg font-semibold text-red-600 mb-2">The Critical Human Factors:</h4>
        <ul class="list-disc ml-6">
            <li>**Reactive vs. Proactive Culture:** A culture prioritizing short-term savings guarantees addressing problems only after they become expensive failures.</li>
            <li>**The Cost of Inexperienced Personnel:** Savings from cheaper labor are instantly overshadowed by the costs of extensive repairs caused by mistakes.</li>
            <li>**The "Burnout" Factor:** Pressure on key experts leads to high stress and loss of know-how due to retirement or resignation.</li>
            <li>**Communication Gap:** Lack of real-time communication between site teams and engineering delays repairs and increases risk.</li>
        </ul>
